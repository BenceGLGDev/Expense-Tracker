\`\`\`
Navigate to the project directory:
\`\`\`bash
cd expense-tracker
\`\`\`

### Step 2: Set Up the Environment
(Optional but recommended) Create and activate a virtual environment:
\`\`\`bash
# On Windows
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# On macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
\`\`\`

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

## **Troubleshooting**

### Error: \`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pandas'\`
This error occurs if the \`pandas\` library is not installed. To resolve:
1. Ensure you’ve installed all dependencies:
   \`\`\`bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   \`\`\`
2. Alternatively, manually install \`pandas\`:
   \`\`\`bash
   pip install pandas
   \`\`\`

### Error: SQLite Database File Not Found
Ensure the \`data/\` directory exists. If not, create it:
\`\`\`bash
mkdir data
\`\`\`
The database file (\`expenses.db\`) will be created automatically on the first run.

### General Issues
- Ensure you’re using the correct Python version:
  \`\`\`bash
  python --version
  \`\`\`
- If you have multiple Python versions installed, use \`python3\` instead of \`python\`.
